							<h2>An introduction about myself</h2>
						</header>
						<p align="justify">Since young, I've had a strong fascination and enthusiasm for technology. As a tech-savvy person, I really enjoy handling gadgets.
						It is fascinating what technology can do for us today. With technology advancing at groundbreaking speeds, it surely does allow me to envision a smart
						nation a few years down the road and I definitely do want to be part of the effort as we transit into a digital age.</p>
						<p align="justify">Having just completed my pre-university education, I am currently serving my national service as
						an instructor for aspiring SAF Logistics Officers. In 2022, i will be pursuing a Bachelor Of Computing (Computer Science) in the National University Of Singapore.</p>
						<p align="justify">My life has revolved alot around sports, mainly triathlon. The life lessons that sports has taught me are countless yet meaningful.
						Aside from the satisfaction that it brings, I am grateful to the people that I have met along the way, who have been very supportive of my pursuit for sporting excellence. </p>

						<h2>What am I doing right now?</h2>
						<p>As I did not have much coding background, it was a long arduous process to learn different programming languages, such as Python
						, HTML, JS. As such, I chose to embark on mini projects as I felt that these would aid my learning process while being interactive and
						rewarding to create a functional product.

								<li><strong>Web Development</strong></li>
								<ul>
									<li>Personal Portfolio Website</li>
									<img src='images/Current Projects/website_page.webp' alt="personal_website_page" class="current_project_image">
									<p>What better way to learn web development than to code your own website! Definitely, this has been one of my
									prouder achivements. Portfolios do not just state and display achievements, they tell a story. The process of
									thinking out the design layout to building a responsive yet engaging website is a long yet rewarding one. It is
									fascinating to see how sentences of code can transform into visual outputs that are enjoyed by many.
									</p>
									<br>
									<li>Business Website</li>
									<img src='images/Current Projects/connectlab_website.webp' alt="business_website_page" class="current_project_image">
									<p>Having created a website using pure programming language, I decided to dive into the world of Online
									Website Builders, such as WordPress. I was requested to help design a functioning website for a Small-Medium
									Enterprise (SME) business. Websites are essential platforms for businesses to increase their traffic count and promote
									their services. Compared to building a website using programming language, Online Website Builders often offer limited features.
									</p>

								<br>
								<li><strong>Telegram Bot</strong></li>
								<img src="images/Current Projects/telegram_bot.webp" alt="telegram_bot" class="current_project_image">
								<p>The world is always finding ways to make life easier. While serving my NS, I realised that many processes at work
								could be automated to offset the workload. One key area of focus was the tracking of attendance. Harnessing the power
								of technology, I created a telegram bot that automates the collection of attendance data based on the user input.
								To tackle the issue of delayed physical data collection, notifications are frequently sent out to remind users to input
								attendance data so that the data is constantly updated. Overall, the implementation of this bot has significantly
								improved attendance data collection, while eliminating the need to manually key in data.
